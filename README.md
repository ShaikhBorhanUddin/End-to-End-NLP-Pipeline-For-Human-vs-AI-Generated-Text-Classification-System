## Overview 

The rapid progress of large language models has transformed text generation across education, media, and digital platforms, enabling AI systems (such as ChatGPT, Claude, and LLaMA) to produce content that closely mimics human writing. While these technologies provide significant benefits, they also bring forth challenges related to academic integrity, fake information, and content authenticity, making the reliable detection of AI-generated text harder than ever. This capstone project addresses the problem of AI vs human text classification by exploring several machine learning–based systems that distinguish between human-written and AI-generated content using linguistic and stylistic patterns instead of source-specific metadata. Multiple datasets of varying sizes were considered and finally integrated and preprocessed to ensure consistency and avoid data leakage. Several classical machine learning, RNN and transformer-based models were explored, with DistilBERT selected for its strong performance and computational efficiency. To enhance transparency and usability (rather than just theoretical exploration), the project includes a web-based demonstration built with Gradio. Users can input text and receive predictions with confidence scores, along with word-level explanations generated through explainability methods such as LIME. The proposed system demonstrates a practical and interpretable approach to AI-generated text detection, with real-world applications in academic integrity, e-commerce review moderation, and social media content verification.
